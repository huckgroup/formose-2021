# To do list

## deal with NorthNet code

Not much of the code is used in these scripts, only these parts are imported:

~~~python
from NorthNet import Classes
from NorthNet import network_generation as n_gen
from NorthNet.network_manipulations.networkx_ops import coordinates as c_ops
~~~

The code will be released with the formose-2021 repository, and will be hosted on the Will-Robin GitHub NorthNet repository.
